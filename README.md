# pyTeleBot

Founding the base of a Telegram Bot coded in Python 3.8, With Travis CI and Heroku CD.

The purpose of this bot is to demonstrate a fundamental and correct implementation of the use of Python Modules, Unit Tests implemented with Travis.com Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment using a Heroku based cloud platform with both a staging/testing branch and a production branch.

Project is starting on 25-Jan-2021 and doesn't not have a fixed completion date. PRs will be welcome once the bot has reached a commit to production status. Comments are welcome immediately simply start an issue with an appropriate tag. Discussion will be in github issues and will soon be connected with a Slash discussion to be announced in the near future.

Initial functionality is to be a weather client, first for US zip codes using weather.gov and later to include the entire planet using an API for global weather that is yet to be determined (suggestions are welcome!)
